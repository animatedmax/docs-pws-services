title: Adding and Binding Services Using the PWS Apps Manager
owner: Apps Manager

<strong><%= modified_date %></strong>

This topic describes using the Pivotal Web Services (PWS) Apps Manager to
add and bind service instances through the Services Marketplace.
The Services Marketplace provides PWS users with self-service, on-demand
provisioning of add-on services.
For more information about specific service providers, refer to the
[Services](./services/index.html) topic.

To use a service with your application, you must access the Services
Marketplace, create and configure an instance of the service, then bind the
service instance to your application.

##<a id='create-instance'></a>Step 2: Creating and Configuring a Service Instance ##

Follow the steps below to create and configure an instance of a service.

1. Complete the **Configure Instance** form with the following information:
    * **Instance Name**: Create a name for this instance of the service.
	Service instance names must be unique within a space.
    * **Add to Space**: From the drop-down list, select the space where you want
	to add the service instance.
    * **Bind to App**: From the drop-down list, select an app.
	Select **[do not bind]** if you do not want to bind the service instance to
	any app at this time.

    Click **Add** to add the service instance. PWS creates the service instance
	in the selected space. If you specify an app, PWS binds the service instance
	to the app.

    <p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: Some services do not support binding. If a service does not support binding, the <strong>Bind to App</strong> drop-down list will not appear.</p>

##<a id='bind-instance'></a>Step 3: Binding a Service Instance to an Application ##

Follow the steps below to bind an existing service instance to an application.

1. In the **Spaces** section of the left navigation panel, select a space.

    <%= image_tag("images/console-service/space-link.png") %>

1. In the **Services** table of the space page, click the row listing the service instance you want to bind.

    <%= image_tag("images/console-service/services-space.png") %>

1. On the service instance page, click **Bind Apps** if the service instance has no bindings and **Edit Bindings** if the service instance has bindings.

1. Select the checkbox for the app or apps you want to bind to your service instance.
1. Click **Save**.

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: Service bindings and unbindings require restarting the app to take effect. You can restart the app from the Apps Manager or with <code>cf restage</code> from the cf Command Line Interface (CLI).</p>
